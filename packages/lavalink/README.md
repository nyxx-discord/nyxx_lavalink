## lavalink

A dart wrapper for the [Lavalink API](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink).

If you're looking to create a Discord bot that uses Lavalink, check out [nyxx](https://pub.dev/packages/nyxx) and [nyxx_lavalink](https://pub.dev/packages/nyxx_lavalink), which provide access to the Discord and Lavalink APIs in a unified way.
