A simple to use wrapper around the [Lavalink](https://lavalink.dev/) API for Discord bots using [nyxx](https://pub.dev/packages/nyxx).

This package does not contain a Lavalink server. Follow the instructions [here](https://lavalink.dev/configuration/binary.html) (or [here](https://lavalink.dev/configuration/docker.html), if you're using Docker) to run a server, then provide the server address when creating your `LavalinkPlugin` instance.

## Other nyxx packages

- [nyxx_commands](https://pub.dev/packages/nyxx_commands): A command framework for handling both simple & complex commands.
- [nyxx_extensions](https://pub.dev/packages/nyxx_extensions): Pagination, emoji utilities and other miscellaneous helpers for developing bots using nyxx.
