  > intended for end developer usage. For example: User is now not exported and its interface `IUser` is available for developers.
  > This change shouldn't have impact of end developers.

Other changes are initial implementation of unit and integration tests to assure correct behavior of internal framework
processes. Also added `Makefile` with common commands that are run during development.
